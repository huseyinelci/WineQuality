# WineQuality
Simple Practice dataset by UCI for Regression or Classification Modelling


# Context

The **two differents** datasets are related to **Red Wine** and **White Wine** variants of the Portuguese "**Vinho Verde**" wine. 
For more details, consult the reference [*Paulo Cortez, A. Cerdeira, F. Almeida, T. Matos and J. Reis*, 2009]. Due to privacy and logistic issues, only physicochemical (inputs) and sensory (the output) variables are available (e.g. there is no data about **grape types, wine brand, wine selling price**, etc.)

These datasets can be viewed as classification or **regression** tasks. The classes are **ordered** and not **balanced** (e.g. there are much more normal wines than excellent or poor ones).

This dataset is also available from the **UCI machine learning repository,** [Source](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wine+Quality)

I *just shared* it to *Kaggle* for **Convenience**. If I am mistaken and the public license type disallowed me from doing so, I will take to remove this dataset, if requested  and notified to me.
